<h1>EcoPackAI</h1>
EcoPackAI is an AI-powered full-stack web platform designed to solve this challenge by recommending optimal packaging materials based on product attributes, sustainability parameters, and industry standards. The system uses machine learning models to assess material suitability and predict both environmental impact (carbon footprint) and cost efficiency. The platform integrates a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard to provide actionable sustainability insights and report measurable reductions in environmental impact, helping organizations make data-driven decisions towards greener supply chains.
<h2>Features</h2>
<li>AI-Driven Material Optimization: Uses machine learning to suggest the best sustainable materials (bioplastics, mushroom packaging, recycled paper) based on product requirements.</li>
<li>Lifecycle Impact Analysis (LCA): Automatically calculates the carbon footprint and environmental impact of different packaging options.</li>
<li>Cost Modeling: Predicts direct and indirect costs, including raw materials, storage, and logistics, helping businesses balance "Green" with "Profitable."</li>
<li>Regulatory Compliance: A built-in engine that checks designs against global sustainability regulations (e.g., EU Green Deal, EPR).</li>
<li>Supply Chain Integration: Optimizes packaging dimensions for logistics to reduce wasted space and transportation emissions.</li>
